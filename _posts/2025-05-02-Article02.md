# Understanding Source-Available vs Open Source Licenses

## 1. Source-Available vs Open Source

### What is "Source-Available"?

Source-available software is released with accessible source code that can be viewed and sometimes modified, but **does not necessarily meet the criteria to be called open-source**. While the source code is available for inspection, these licenses often include restrictions that violate the Open Source Initiative (OSI) definition.

The key difference lies in the licensing terms: source-available licenses may impose restrictions on usage, distribution, or commercialization that are incompatible with true open source principles.

### Examples of Source-Available Licenses

#### Commons Clause
**What it does:** An addendum to existing open-source licenses that restricts users from selling the software.

**OSI Violations:**
- **Criterion #1 (Free Redistribution):** Explicitly prohibits selling the software, violating the principle that licenses should not restrict parties from selling or giving away the software
- **Criterion #6 (No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor):** Restricts commercial use, discriminating against business activities

#### Business Source License (BSL)
**What it does:** Prohibits use of the code in production environments without a commercial license. After a specified time period, the code becomes available under a traditional open-source license.

**OSI Violations:**
- **Criterion #6 (No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor):** Restricts production use, discriminating against commercial deployment
- **Criterion #1 (Free Redistribution):** Requires commercial licensing for production use, effectively imposing fees for certain usage

#### Functional Source License (FSL)
**What it does:** Prohibits "competing" use of the code to preserve the author's economic rights, but converts to Apache or MIT License after a limited time.

**OSI Violations:**
- **Criterion #6 (No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor):** Restricts competitive use, discriminating against specific business models
- **Criterion #5 (No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups):** Could discriminate against competitors or similar businesses

#### GitLab Enterprise Edition License
**What it does:** Used exclusively for GitLab's commercial offering, making the Enterprise Edition proprietary while maintaining an open-source Community Edition.

**OSI Violations:**
- **Multiple criteria:** GitLab openly acknowledges this makes their EE product "proprietary, closed source code"
- Represents an "open core" model rather than true open source

### Why These Restrictions Matter

These source-available licenses attempt to balance:
- **Developer interests:** Protecting revenue streams and preventing competitors from free-riding
- **Community benefits:** Allowing code inspection, learning, and some modification
- **Business models:** Enabling sustainable funding for development


## 2. Artificial Intelligence Software

### What does the OpenRAILs license try to do?

OpenRAILs (Open & Responsible AI Licenses) represents a new licensing paradigm specifically designed for AI artifacts that attempts to balance openness with responsibility. The license framework has two main features:

**Open aspects:**
- Allows royalty-free access to AI models
- Permits flexible downstream use and redistribution
- Enables distribution of derivatives

**Responsible aspects:**
- Embeds specific **use-based restrictions** for identified critical scenarios
- Prohibits use of AI models for harmful purposes (e.g., military targeting, generating harmful content)
- Requires downstream adopters to maintain the same use restrictions
- Acts as a deterrent against potential misuse through legal accountability

The OpenRAILs approach recognizes that AI models are fundamentally different from traditional software code and therefore require specialized licensing that accounts for their unique capabilities and potential for harm. Examples include BigScience OpenRAIL-M, StableDiffusion's CreativeML OpenRAIL-M, and BigScience BLOOM RAIL v1.0.

### Would OSI judge that license to be "open source"?

**No, the OSI would likely NOT consider OpenRAILs to be "open source"** due to fundamental violations of the Open Source Definition.

**Key OSI violations:**

**Criterion #6 (No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor):**
- OpenRAILs explicitly restrict use in specific fields or applications (e.g., military targeting, harmful content generation)
- The OSI definition states: "The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor"
- Use-based restrictions directly contradict this principle

**Criterion #5 (No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups):**
- Restrictions on "harmful uses" could indirectly discriminate against certain user groups
- Determining what constitutes "harmful use" may vary based on cultural, political, or ethical perspectives

**Criterion #1 (Free Redistribution):**
- While redistribution is generally allowed, the requirement to maintain use-based restrictions could be seen as limiting the freedom of redistribution
- The copyleft-style behavioral restrictions may impose additional obligations beyond traditional open source requirements

### The Fundamental Tension

OpenRAILs represents an attempt to solve a real problem: traditional open source licenses were designed for code, not AI models with their unique potential for societal impact. However, this solution comes at the cost of abandoning core open source principles.

The OSI's definition prioritizes **freedom of use** over **responsible use**, reflecting the belief that restrictions on fields of endeavor are inherently problematic, regardless of good intentions. OpenRAILs prioritizes **responsible use** over **unrestricted freedom**, making it incompatible with the OSI definition despite its beneficial goals.
